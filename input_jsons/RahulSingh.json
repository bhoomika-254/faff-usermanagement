You can go to the Karaköy area for some famous eateries and lounges near Galata Bridge for a great view. Some popular spots for this:\n1. Loi Bosphorus: Very well rated restaurant with traditional Turkish cuisine and a great view.\n2. Kapı Karaköy: Known for its kebabs and  ⁠mezes;\n3. ⁠ Karaköy Güllüoğlu: Famous for its Baklava and Turkish tea. Does not serve hookah though\n\nIf you have the time (>6 hours) and energy, you can also go for the city tour. Turkish Airlines offers a free city tour for their passengers with a long layover. You can also visit the Haga Sophia if the layover is at night.",

We have talked to an agent, and they have recommended a hospital to get it done. You will have to visit with your Aadhar and request the doctor to issue a certificate with their letterhead mentioning your age as per Aadhar, and they will do it after taking some money.\n\nBowring and Lady Curzon Hospital (https://g.co/kgs/viYL43D)\n\nWe are trying to connect with the hospital over the phone to get more information, but haven't been lucky yet.\n\nThere is an online option too, but we'll need to log in to the Karnataka Seva Sindhu portal using your DigiLocker account to apply for this."

This is a subjective call based on how big a fan of the artist you are and what matters to you in a concert. For example, I personally am okay not seeing the artist via direct eye contact and seeing them on the big screen. I think sections 300 and 400 seem to be good value for money. If you have specific date preferences, I can make specific seat and money recommendations to you.\n\nI'd also recommend waiting for a few weeks, as it is likely that the prices are going to go down. Given that there are 4 shows and many people are selling already, there's a good chance that the market will sell below the original price. However, if you're a big fan and can't take the risk, you should consider buying this week.",

The problem with our workflow is when a task is not happening successfully the team tends to not share it and waits for it to happen and then share it. Logging it and discussing it in the next meet. \n\nFor now, shall we give a shot using some AI tools?

He’s also taken the initiative to speak to his Spanish professor, who might be willing to step in and offer more confident support if needed.\n\n2. In parallel, we’ve reached out to another contact as well. While he’s not very confident, he’s open to helping and doing his best wherever possible.\n\nIn the meantime, if you could share the key points or context you'd like us to communicate, we can start preparing and pass it along so they can help translate and communicate it in the most accurate and meaningful way.\nWe genuinely understand how important this is, and we’re doing everything we can to find the right support.
